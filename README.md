# TimeTickBase (TTB)
Harnessing time as trustless blockchain infrastructure

*Preview Release â€“ January 2025*

TimeTickBase is a time-based token system built on the Polygon network that creates a direct relationship between time and token generation through smart contracts.

## Core Principles

- Built on Polygon (PoS)
- No arbitrary minting or supply manipulation
- Pure mathematics drives the system
