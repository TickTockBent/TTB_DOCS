# TimeTickBase (TTB)
*Preview Release â€“ January 2025*

TimeTickBase is a time-based token system built on the Polygon network that creates a direct relationship between time and token generation through smart contracts.

## Core Principles

- One token is generated per second
- Immutable core contract
- Tokens can be staked individually via dapp or collectively through aggregator contract structures
- Staking is done in atomic units of one stake-hour (3,600 TTB) with a variable minimum stake
- 70% of new tokens go to stakers, 30% to development fund
- No premine, or presale

## Key Features
