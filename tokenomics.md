# TimeTickBase (TTB) Tokenomics
*Version 1.0 - January 2025*

## Core Principles

TimeTickBase implements pure, predictable tokenomics built on immutable mathematical foundations:
- One token generated per second, forever
- No premine, no presale, no team allocation
- Supply starts at zero and increases linearly with time
- No arbitrary minting capability
- No administrator control over supply

## Distribution Model

TTB maintains a straightforward distribution that aligns incentives across the ecosystem:

**Active Network:**
- 70% of emissions to stakers
- 30% to development fund

**Pre-activation:**
- 100% to development fund
- Transitions to active model with Genesis Fountain

## Development Fund

The development fund ensures sustainable ecosystem growth through:
- Security audits and infrastructure
- Community development initiatives
- Bug bounties and security research
- Ongoing maintenance and support
- Network infrastructure costs

Key features:
- Multi-signature control
- Transparent quarterly reporting
- Governance oversight
- Fixed release schedules

## Genesis Period

The Genesis Fountain marks TTB's transition to full network activation through:
- Fixed 12-month duration
- Controlled stake activation
- Natural dilution mechanism
- Community-focused slot distribution
- Progressive decentralization

## Governance 

TTB implements a balanced governance system that:
- Requires significant stake commitment
- Maintains economic alignment
- Ensures protocol stability
- Enables community control
- Protects core immutability

Through these mechanisms, TTB establishes a foundation for sustainable infrastructure development while maintaining absolute security and predictability.
